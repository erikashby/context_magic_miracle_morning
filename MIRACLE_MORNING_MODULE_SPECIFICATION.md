# Miracle Morning Module Specification

## Overview
This specification defines what the Miracle Morning module should support based on Hal Elrod's methodology and the AI Context Service architecture. The module should provide comprehensive support for practitioners at all levels, from complete beginners to advanced users seeking optimization.

## Core Methodology: SAVERS Framework

**S** - **Silence**: Meditation, prayer, breathing exercises, or mindful moments  
**A** - **Affirmations**: Positive self-talk and empowering personal statements  
**V** - **Visualization**: Mental rehearsal of goals, success, and ideal outcomes  
**E** - **Exercise**: Physical movement to energize body and mind  
**R** - **Reading**: Personal development, learning, and growth content  
**S** - **Scribing**: Journaling, gratitude practice, and written reflection  

## Target User Segments

### 1. Complete Beginners
- Never practiced morning routines consistently
- Need structure, guidance, and habit formation support
- Benefit from longer practice sessions to learn each component deeply
- Require extensive AI coaching and encouragement

### 2. Developing Practitioners

## Routine Duration Framework

### Beginner Routines (Recommended starting point)
- **30-60 minute routine**: 5-10 minutes per SAVERS component
  - Allows proper learning and embodiment of each practice
  - Builds strong foundational habits
  - Provides sufficient time for meaningful engagement
  
- **20-minute routine**: 3-4 minutes per component (minimum for beginners)
  - For those with severe time constraints
  - Still allows meaningful practice of each element

### Intermediate Routines
- **15-30 minutes**: 2.5-5 minutes per component
  - For practitioners comfortable with all SAVERS elements
  - Balanced efficiency and effectiveness

### Advanced/Optimization Routines
- **6-minute routine**: 1 minute per component
  - For experienced practitioners who've mastered the full routine
  - Quick daily maintenance for established habits
  - Requires prior deep familiarity with each SAVERS component

- **3-minute routine**: 30 seconds per component (emergency version)
  - Absolute minimum for maintaining streak during challenging periods
