# Daily Tracking

This folder contains your routine completion tracking and insights capture. The tracking system is designed to be simple for daily use while capturing valuable insights for routine optimization.

## Folder Structure

- `current-week/` - This week's daily tracking files
- `monthly-summaries/` - Monthly pattern analysis and insights
- `streak-tracking.md` - Consistency metrics and achievement tracking

## Daily Tracking Approach

### Simple Completion Tracking
Each day includes basic completion checkboxes for all SAVERS components:
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Full component completion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial** - Started but didn't complete fully  
- ‚ùå **Skipped** - Didn't do this component
- üö´ **Not Planned** - Intentionally excluded from today's routine

### Insights Capture
Key components (especially Affirmations and Visualization) include space for:
- **Effectiveness Rating** (1-5 scale)
- **Key Insights** (what resonated, what didn't)
- **Emotional Impact** (how it made you feel)
- **Connection to Goals** (relevance to your objectives)

### Overall Day Assessment
- **Energy Level** (1-10 before and after routine)
- **Mood Impact** (positive/neutral/negative effect)
- **Time Taken** (actual vs. planned duration)
- **Success Factors** (what helped completion)
- **Obstacles** (what made it challenging)

## Weekly Workflow

### Daily (1-2 minutes)
- Check off completed components
- Rate 1-2 key insights if something stood out
- Note overall energy/mood impact

### Weekly (5-10 minutes)  
- Review week's patterns with AI assistant
- Identify what worked well and what didn't
- Plan any routine adjustments for next week
- Celebrate progress and streaks

### Monthly (15-20 minutes)
- Deep pattern analysis with AI assistant
- Update routine settings based on what you've learned
- Set goals for next month's practice
- Update affirmations, reading list, or other content

## Privacy and Simplicity

This tracking system is designed to:
- **Minimize Time Investment** - Quick daily tracking, deeper weekly reviews
- **Focus on Useful Data** - Only track what helps optimize your routine
- **Respect Privacy** - All insights stay in your personal context
- **Enable AI Coaching** - Provide data for personalized optimization suggestions

## Getting Started

Your AI assistant will help you:
1. Set up your first week's tracking files
2. Understand what to track and when
3. Develop a sustainable tracking rhythm
4. Use tracking data for routine optimization

Remember: The goal is consistency and optimization, not perfect tracking. Track what helps, skip what doesn't add value.
