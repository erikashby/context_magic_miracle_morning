## Common Beginner Challenges & Solutions

### "It's Too Long"
- **Start with 30 minutes** and build up gradually
- **Focus on consistency** over perfection
- **Remember**: This investment pays dividends all day long

### "I Don't Know What to Read/Say/Do"
- **Use provided templates** and suggestions initially

- **Start simple** - complexity comes with experience

### "I Feel Silly Doing Affirmations"
- **Completely normal!** Most people feel this way initially
- **Start with affirmations that feel believable**

- **Practice makes progress** - visualization is a skill that improves

### "I'm Not a Morning Person"
- **Start with small changes** - wake up just 10 minutes earlier initially

- **Remember**: Becoming a morning person is a choice and a skill

### "I Keep Missing Days"
